Client Side part of this mod
This mod, unlike the server version, can be used on all servers and only needs to be installed by the player

But if you need a server version that can only be used if it is installed on the server download:

ElytraSwapperPlus

 

Important!
 

This mod can be used on all servers, but before using it, read the rules of use carefully, otherwise you may be kicked or even banned.

Description

ElytraSwapper+ is a next-generation utility that allows the player to swap the chestplate and elytra whenever needed.
 

You will be able to use ElytraSwapper + anywhere without installing it on the server, but simply by downloading the mod

How it works?
1. Regular bind
The way it works is that when you assign a key in the settings (by default it's R), when you press it the elytra will swap places with the chest and elytra or back, depending on what chest you have.
2. Auto swap
This function consists in the fact that when it is enabled by bind (by default it's B), when you fall from a height higher than 2 blocks, you will automatically equip the elytra so as not to accidentally fall from a height.
 
Easy like a pie!üç∞
